## Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

You will be working on this project with [ Google Colab] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Neq9kkKsk-mYGdH8gwclFsjnqzA7pZD_#scrollTo=jd2SLCh8oxMh)

After going to that link, create a copy of the notebook either in your own account or locally. Once you complete the project and it passes the test (included at that link), submit your project link below. If you are submitting a Google Colaboratory link, make sure to turn on link sharing for "anyone with the link."

We are still developing the interactive instructional content for the machine learning curriculum. For now, you can go through the video challenges in this certification. You may also have to seek out additional learning resources, similar to what you would do when working on a real-world project.

In this challenge, you will create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.

In this project, you will use the Book-Crossings dataset, which contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users. The dataset is already imported in the notebook, so no additional download is required.

Use NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures the distance to determine the “closeness” of instances.

Create a function named get_recommends that takes a book title (from the dataset) as an argument and returns a list of 5 similar books with their distances from the book argument
