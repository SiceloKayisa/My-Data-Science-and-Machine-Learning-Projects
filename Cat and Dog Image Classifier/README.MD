## ‚≠ê Key Achievements (Quantifiable Metrics)

* **Classification Performance:** Achieved a final test accuracy of **74.0%** on the specialized 50-image test set, meeting the challenge passing requirements.
* **Dataset Utilization:** Model trained and validated on a total of **3,000 images** (2,000 for training, 1,000 for validation).
* **Architecture & Training:**
    * Trained the model over **5 epochs** using a `BATCH_SIZE` of 100.
    * Employed a deep architecture featuring **3 Conv2D blocks** and a **Dropout rate of 0.2** for robust regularization.
* **Input Standardization:** Successfully implemented preprocessing to resize all images to a consistent **150x150** input dimension and **normalized** pixel values to the $0-1$ range.

## üéØ Project Aims

The primary goals of this project were:

1.  **Build a Robust Classifier:** Create a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying images of cats and dogs.
2.  **Master CNN Fundamentals:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing CNN architectures, including the use of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
3.  **Implement Best Practices:** Utilize appropriate techniques for image preprocessing, data loading, and model compilation (e.g., using `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` with logits).
