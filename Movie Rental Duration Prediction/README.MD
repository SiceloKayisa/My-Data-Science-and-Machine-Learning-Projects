## Movie Rental Duration Prediction ðŸŽ¬
This project focuses on predicting the duration of movie rentals using various machine learning regression models. By analyzing historical rental data, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately estimate how long a movie will be rented.

### Project Goal ðŸŽ¯
The primary objective of this project is to compare the performance of different regression techniques in predicting movie rental duration and identify the most effective model for this task.

### Dataset ðŸ“Š
The project utilizes a rental_info.csv dataset, which contains information about movie rentals, including rental dates, return dates, and special features of the movies.

**Columns of interest in the dataset:**

rental_date: The date when the movie was rented.

return_date: The date when the movie was returned.

special_features: A string indicating special features (e.g., "Deleted Scenes", "Behind the Scenes").

Features & Technologies âœ¨
Data Preparation: Calculating rental duration in days and creating dummy variables for special_features.

Feature Engineering: Deriving rental_length_days, deleted_scenes, and behind_the_scenes.

Machine Learning Models:

Lasso Regression: Used for feature selection to identify important predictors.

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression: Applied to the features selected by Lasso.

Random Forest Regressor: A powerful ensemble model for robust predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Employing RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model's performance.

Model Evaluation: Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric to assess model accuracy.

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation.

numpy for numerical operations.

scikit-learn for machine learning models and utilities (train_test_split, mean_squared_error, Lasso, LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, RandomizedSearchCV).
